						<b>pH</b>
						<p>	
If you’re doing any kind of growing, you’ve likely heard of pH. But what is pH and why is it important?

No time to read? Skip to the <a href="#keypoints"><b>KEY POINTS</b></a>
<p>
							
	<b>What is pH?</b> 
	
pH is a scale (0-14) which indicates how acidic or basic a solution is. pH stands for power of Hydrogen and is a measurement of hydrogen ions. Less then 7 is acidic, greater is basic (no basic bitches here), and 7 is neutral.
<p>
INSERT PICTURE OF SCALE
<p>
The scale is <b>logarithmic</b>, if the pH changes by 1, it 10x more intense. A pH of 6 is 10x more acidic than 7. A pH of 5 is 100x more acidic than 7, 4 is 1000x more, 3 is 10,000x , well, you get the point. We'll talk more about this later.
<p><p>
							
	<b>Why do we care about pH?</b>
As pH changes, so does the chemical composition of the soil, which impacts the availability of nutrients. Worst case scenario, your pH is so far off that nutrients are not available to your plant, commonly referred as nutrient lockout in the marijuana industry. 
<p>
Without nutrients, your plants will stop growing and will die. We’re looking for a pH that maximizes the number of nutrients available. What is this magic number?
<p><p>
<b>Proper pH</b>
Like most plants, marijuana plants thrive in slightly acidic soil, a pH range of 6-7 is optimal. Working in a range helps keep things simple but it’s always best to err on the side of neutral (closer to 7) - remember a pH of 6 is 10x more acidic than 7. 

The golden number here is 6.66, remember this is the devil’s lettuce. Now we’ve identified the end goal, but how do we get there?
<p>

<b>Measuring pH</b>
Measuring pH is something anyone can do. Any of the following methods can be used to measure pH.<ul>
<li>digital meter</li>
<li>pH probe</li>
<li>litmus strips</li>
<li>mixing kit</li>
</ul>

Digital meters are dipped in water and provide instant readings. A high quality digital meter will give the most accurate results. Digital meters will require recalibration, which you can do yourself. Follow the instructions provided with your meter.
<p><p>
A pH probe is pushed into the soil and reads pH directly, they are usually inexpensive but wildly inaccurate so we don’t recommend them. 
<p>
A litmus strip (think highschool science class) is a cheap way to give you an idea of your soils pH. They are dipped in water and change colour. They aren't very accurate.
<p>						
Mixing kits give more accurate results, but like litmus strips, rely on the user to identify colours. If you’re colour blind (like me) this can cause some problems.
<p>						
We recommend investing in a high quality digital meter and checking it against a mixing kit and/or litmus strips. Check the pH of your supply water as this will have the greatest impact on soil pH. If you run into problems, checking the pH of your runoff will you give you an idea of your soil's pH.
<p><p>
							<b>Correcting pH</b>
It may seem obvious that if your pH is low, you want to increase it. You’re right to assume this, but the approach is crucial.
<p>
Consider pH correction like temperature correction. It’s 19 degrees (Canada eh?) in your house and you feel that 20 would be more comfortable. You set your thermostat to 20, not 21. Imagine if 21 degrees was 10x hotter than 20. By overshooting by one degree you would run into some major issues! By overshooting, or undershooting, you are risking massive swings in pH which affect the composition of your soil and nutrient availability, putting your plants at great risk to many issues. Plants can tolerate a greater swing in pH than humans in temperature, but It’s best to approach all change gradually.
<p>
There are many pH adjustors available that are specifically designed to raise, lower or neutralize pH. When correcting pH you must adjust the pH of the supply water after adding nutrients, as many nutrients will affect the pH.
<p>
							<b>Tips</b>
The most common pH problem is soil acidification. This is commonly caused by using chemical fertilizers, which lower soil pH over time. Adding dolomitic lime to your soil mix will help. Dolomitic lime is a natural pH neutralizer and has the added benefits of calcium and magnesium which aid in plant growth. Ad it to your soil mix and it will slowly release throughout the grow avoiding soil acidification.

If you’re in a pinch, you can add vinegar to your water to lower the pH, or baking soda to raise it.

							<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>pH = power of Hydrogen (concentration of hydrogen ions)</li>
<li>0-14 scale, less than 7 is acidic, greater than 7 is basic, 7 is neutral</li>
<li>Scale is logarithmic - a change in pH of 1 is equal to 10 times.</li>
<li>Marijuana prefers ~6.5-6.8</li>
<li>Invest is a quality meter and stay on top of it, it’s a small amount of work to avoid big headaches</li>
<li>Dolomitic lime is a great way to raise pH, it also adds calcium and magnesium which are commonly deficient in marijuana plants.</li>
