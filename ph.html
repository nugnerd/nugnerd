							<h3>pH</h3>
							
							

If you’re doing any kind of growing, you’ve likely heard of pH. But what is pH and why is it important?

No time to read? Skip to the <a href="#keypoints"><b>KEY POINTS</b></a>
<p>
							<h3>What?</h3>
What is pH? pH is a scale (0-14) used to indicate how acidic or basic a solution is. pH stands for power of Hydrogen and it actually measures the concentration of hydrogen ions. A pH less than 7 is acidic, greater than 7 is basic (no basic bitches here), and 7 is neutral.

INSERT PICTURE OF SCALE

It’s important to know that the scale is logarithmic, which means a change in pH by 1 is equal to 10 times the intensity. So a pH of 6 is 10x more acidic than 7. A pH of 5 is 100x more acidic than 7, 4 is 1000x more, 3 is 10,000x , well, you get the point. We’ll touch on the importance of this later on.
<p>
							<h3>Why?</h3>
Why do we care about pH? Like humans, plants need water to live and thrive. The quality of water greatly impacts the health of your plant. You wouldn’t want to drink acid (maybe on a small square piece of paper) and neither does a plant. 

As pH changes, so does the chemical composition of the soil, which impacts the availability of nutrients. Worst case scenario, your pH is so far off that the nutrients are not available to your plant, this commonly referred as nutrient lockout in the marijuana industry. 

Without nutrients, your plants will not be able to grow and will eventually die. Some nutrients are readily available at a higher pH, others at lower. Plants like consistency, and gradual changes, so we’re looking for a pH that maximizes the number of nutrients available. What is this magic number?
<p>
							<h3>Proper pH</h3>
Marijuana plants thrive is slightly acidic soil, so a pH range of 6-7 is optimal. It’s best to focus on a range to keep things simple and it’s always best to err on the side of neutral (closer to 7) - remember a pH of 6 is 10x more acidic than 7. 

The golden number here is 6.66, remember this is the devil’s lettuce. The vast majority of all plants and trees grow in this range, not just marijuana. We’ve identified the end goal, but how do we get there?
<p>
							<h3>Measuring pH</h3>
Before trying to get somewhere, you need to know where you’re coming from. You need a starting point, in this case, the pH of your soil. Fortunately it can be measured! What you’ll want to measure is:  the water going in, the water coming out (runoff) and the soil itself. You can use the following to measure pH.
<ul>
<li>litmus strips</li>
<li>pH probe</li>
<li>digital meter</li>
<li>mixing kit</li>
</ul>

Digital meters are dipped in water and provide instant readings. A high quality digital meter will give the most accurate results. Digital meters will require recalibration, it’s not difficult and you can do it. Follow the instructions provided with your meter.

A pH probe is pushed into the soil and reads pH directly, they are usually inexpensive but wildly inaccurate so we don’t recommend them. 

A litmus strip (think back to highschool science class) is an inexpensive way to find out whether your soil is acidic, neutral or basic, but we’re looking for accuracy, so I recommend never relying on strips alone. 

Mixing kits give fairly accurate results, but like litmus strips, rely on the user to identify colours. If you’re colour blind (like me) this can cause some problems. Even if you’re an interior designer, it’s difficult to be accurate with a mixing kit.

We recommend investing in a high quality digital meter and checking it against a mixing kit and/or litmus strips. You should always check the pH of the water you are supplying your plants as this will have the greatest impact on soil pH. If you start running into problems (hopefully not), checking the pH of your runoff will give you a starting point to work off.
<p>
							<h3>Correcting pH</h3>
Remember when I mentioned the importance of the logarithmic scale? This is where it comes in. It may seem obvious that if your pH is low, you want to increase it. You’re right to assume this, but the approach is crucial.

Consider pH correction like temperature correction. It’s 19 degrees (Canada eh?) in your house and you feel that 20 would be more comfortable. You set your thermostat to 20, not 21. This seems pretty straight forward, and it is. Now imagine if 21 degrees was 10x hotter than 20. By overshooting by one degree you would run into some major issues! That’s exactly how pH works! By overshooting, or undershooting, you are risking massive swings in pH which affect the composition of your soil and nutrient availability, putting your plants at great risk to many issues. Plants can tolerate a greater swing in pH than humans in temperature, but It’s best to approach all change gradually.

There are many pH adjustors in the market that are specifically designed to raise or lower or neutralize pH. When correcting pH you must adjust the pH of the supply water after adding nutrients, as many nutrients will affect the pH.
<p>
							<h3>Tips</h3>
The most common pH problem is soil acidification. This is usually caused by using chemical fertilizers, which have a tendency to lower pH over time. A common trick is to add dolomitic lime to your soil mix. Dolomitic lime is a natural pH neutralizer and has the added benefits of calcium and magnesium which aid in plant growth. It will slowly release throughout the grow and help maintain a neutral pH.

If you’re in a pinch, you can add vinegar to your water to lower the pH, or baking soda to raise it.

							<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>pH = power of Hydrogen (concentration of hydrogen ions)</li>
<li>0-14 scale, less than 7 is acidic, greater than 7 is basic, 7 is neutral</li>
<li>Scale is logarithmic - a change in pH of 1 is equal to 10 times.</li>
<li>Marijuana prefers ~6.5-6.8</li>
<li>Invest is a quality meter and stay on top of it, it’s a small amount of work to avoid big headaches</li>
<li>Dolomitic lime is a great way to raise pH, it also adds calcium and magnesium which are commonly deficient in marijuana plants.</li>
